# flmidi-101

A comprehensive guide for making FL Studio MIDI scripts.

This guide is NOT a replacement for the official [MIDI Scripting API Documentation](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm) from Image-Line, but rather a complementary guide to the main documentation to compile some tricks and techniques used to make scripts as well as a more detailed guide for beginners that might not understand the manual itself due to some left out concepts that aren't explained on the main documentation due not being specific to FL Studio (Python programming, how to properly work with the scripts...).
