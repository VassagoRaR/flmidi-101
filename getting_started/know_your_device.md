# Know your device

Now that you know how the MIDI protocol works, before telling FL Studio about your MIDI device you'll need to know what you have to tell. Your device has it's own way of communicating with DAW software and you need to know how it interacts with them in order to script for FL Studio. How you do it? Through reverse engineering.

**Note:** DO NOT EVER TRY TO DECOMPILE THE PROPIETARY DRIVER(S) OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO KNOW THE MIDI SPECIFICATION OF THE DEVICE. There's a high chance you'll either be doing something that is either illegal (like breaking IP or patent rights) or against some sort of EULA contract from the manufacturer.
